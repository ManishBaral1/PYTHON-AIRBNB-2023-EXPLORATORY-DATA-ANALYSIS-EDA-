### DATA SOURCE
The data for our EDA was taken from kaggle. Newyork City Airbnb 2023 data is a public data. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godofoutcasts/new-york-city-airbnb-2023-public-data)


### Project Summary

This project is dedicated to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings. With a global reach, Airbnb relies heavily on data analysis to enhance its operations. The platform generates extensive data from millions of listings, which can be leveraged for security, business decisions, understanding customer and provider behavior, innovation, marketing initiatives, and more. Our analysis focuses on historical data from Airbnb listings in New York, a prominent destination for tourism and business.

Our dataset contains approximately 49,931 records and 18 attributes. We began by importing the dataset and the necessary libraries to understand the variables. We performed comprehensive EDA, examining numeric and categorical features through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Following this, we treated outliers and null values, transforming the data to ensure compatibility with model building and predictions if required.

### 1. Problem Statement

Airbnb is a prominent online marketplace that connects homeowners wishing to rent their properties with travelers seeking accommodations. It offers a straightforward, stress-free way for homeowners to generate income. New York City, a leading hub for tourism and business, is the focus of our analysis. Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has broadened travel possibilities, offering unique and personalized experiences.

Airbnb's primary revenue stream comes from service fees on bookings. Guests often find Airbnb accommodations more affordable, characterful, and homelier than hotels. This project aims to:

- Conduct EDA on the dataset using Numpy and Pandas to uncover relationships between variables.
- Identify key features significant for Airbnb from a business perspective.
- Perform cost and revenue analysis to pinpoint groups where Airbnb can enhance profitability.
- Analyze customer ratings to discern sentiment and explore the relationship between price and user ratings.

### Business Context

Airbnb's innovative model has revolutionized the travel and hospitality industry, offering personalized experiences for travelers and a convenient income source for property owners. Data analysis is pivotal to Airbnb's strategy, enabling informed decision-making, ensuring security, and fostering innovation based on customer and provider behaviors.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data cleaning is a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. We addressed null values by employing techniques such as imputation, where missing values were replaced with the mean or median of the column, and in some cases, dropped columns or rows with excessive missing data. Understanding and handling skewness in the data was essential; we applied log transformations to normalize skewed data.

Outliers were identified and treated using statistical methods and visualization tools. By using z-scores and IQR methods, we either corrected or removed extreme values that could skew the results. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were instrumental in this process, allowing us to graphically identify outliers and understand the distribution of our data.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

We utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library in Python to preprocess textual data before modeling. This included steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming. These preprocessing steps helped in transforming the text data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling.

### Data Modeling and Prediction

In addition to exploratory data analysis, we also undertook data modeling and prediction. We focused on predicting prices based on various attributes. We employed four different models using the powerful Scikit-Learn (sklearn) library:

1. **Linear Regression Model**
2. **Decision Tree Model**
3. **Lasso Model**
4. **Ridge Model**

Scikit-Learn is an essential library for machine learning in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling, ensuring robust performance and ease of implementation. Our analysis revealed that the Decision Tree Model exhibited the highest RÂ² value and the lowest error, making it the most effective model. Based on this model, we developed a recommendation system to aid in decision-making.



This project underscores the significance of data analysis in enhancing Airbnb's operational strategies, ensuring a better understanding of the market, and driving innovation and growth.
